/**
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

	 * We will use HashMap. 
	 * The key thing is to keep track of the sequence length and store that in the boundary points of the sequence. 
	 * For example, as a result, for sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, map.get(1) and map.get(5) should both return 5.
	 * 
	 * Whenever a new element n is inserted into the map, do two things:
	 * (1)See if n - 1 and n + 1 exist in the map, 
	 *    and if so, it means there is an existing sequence next to n. 
	 *    Variables left and right will be the length of those two sequences, 
	 *    while 0 means there is no sequence and n will be the boundary point later. 
	 *    Store (left + right + 1) as the associated value to key n into the map.
	 * (2)Use left and right to locate the other end of the sequences to the left and right of n respectively, 
	 *    and replace the value with the new length.
	 * Everything inside the for loop is O(1) so the total time is O(n). 
	 * Please comment if you see something wrong. Thanks.
