/**
Given a non negative integer number num. 
For every numbers i in the range 0 �� i �� num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

Follow up:

	It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). 
But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
	Space complexity should be O(n).
	Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
